Python keyword based categorization
ChatGPT said:
Keyword-based categorization in Python typically means assigning categories (or labels) to text data based on the presence of specific keywords. Here's a basic explanation and a sample code snippet to get you started.

üß† Concept
You have a list of categories, and each category has a set of keywords. You scan text for those keywords and assign the category if a match is found.

üß™ Example
Suppose you want to categorize customer support queries:

‚úÖ Categories:
Billing

Technical Support

General Inquiry

‚úÖ Associated Keywords:
categories = {
    "Billing": ["invoice", "payment", "refund", "charge", "bill"],
    "Technical Support": ["error", "crash", "bug", "issue", "not working"],
    "General Inquiry": ["information", "details", "how to", "what is"]
}
üßæ Python Code
def categorize_text(text, categories):
    text = text.lower()
    for category, keywords in categories.items():
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword in text:
                return category
    return "Uncategorized"

# Example data
queries = [
    "I need a refund for my last payment.",
    "The app keeps crashing whenever I try to log in.",
    "Can you give me more information about your plans?",
    "Where is my order?",
]

# Categorize
for query in queries:
    category = categorize_text(query, categories)
    print(f"Query: '{query}' ‚Üí Category: {category}")
üñ®Ô∏è Output
Query: 'I need a refund for my last payment.' ‚Üí Category: Billing
Query: 'The app keeps crashing whenever I try to log in.' ‚Üí Category: Technical Support
Query: 'Can you give me more information about your plans?' ‚Üí Category: General Inquiry
Query: 'Where is my order?' ‚Üí Category: Uncategorized
üîß Tips for Improvement
Use regex for better pattern matching (e.g., word boundaries).

Use multiple category assignment if more than one keyword matches.

Integrate fuzzy matching (like fuzzywuzzy or RapidFuzz) to handle typos.

For large-scale tasks, consider TF-IDF + cosine similarity or machine learning models.

Would you like to include multiple category matches or use a more advanced method?

Email classification based on keywords
ChatGPT said:
To classify emails based on keywords in Python, you can follow a similar strategy as keyword-based categorization. Here's a complete, functional example:

üì® Goal:
Classify incoming emails into categories like:

Work

Personal

Promotions

Spam

‚úÖ Step 1: Define Categories & Keywords
email_categories = {
    "Work": ["meeting", "project", "deadline", "report", "client"],
    "Personal": ["birthday", "party", "family", "friend", "catch up"],
    "Promotions": ["discount", "offer", "sale", "deal", "limited time"],
    "Spam": ["lottery", "winner", "free money", "prize", "click here"]
}
‚úÖ Step 2: Categorization Function
def classify_email(email_text, categories):
    email_text = email_text.lower()
    for category, keywords in categories.items():
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword in email_text:
                return category
    return "Uncategorized"
‚úÖ Step 3: Sample Emails
emails = [
    "Don't miss our limited time offer on electronics!",
    "Hey, are you free this weekend to catch up?",
    "Client meeting rescheduled to next Monday.",
    "Congratulations! You are a lottery winner!",
    "Let's finalize the project report by Friday."
]
‚úÖ Step 4: Run Classification
for email in emails:
    category = classify_email(email, email_categories)
    print(f"Email: '{email}' ‚Üí Category: {category}")
üñ®Ô∏è Expected Output
Email: 'Don't miss our limited time offer on electronics!' ‚Üí Category: Promotions  
Email: 'Hey, are you free this weekend to catch up?' ‚Üí Category: Personal  
Email: 'Client meeting rescheduled to next Monday.' ‚Üí Category: Work  
Email: 'Congratulations! You are a lottery winner!' ‚Üí Category: Spam  
Email: 'Let's finalize the project report by Friday.' ‚Üí Category: Work  
üõ†Ô∏è Enhancements (Optional)
‚úÖ Multiple category support (if an email matches more than one).

‚úÖ Regex to catch phrases more accurately.

‚úÖ Fuzzy matching for typos using RapidFuzz.

‚úÖ Stemming/Lemmatization with nltk or spaCy.

‚úÖ Machine learning for smarter classification when keyword rules aren't enough.

Would you like help with enhancements or using libraries like spaCy or scikit-learn for smarter email classification?

How to use spacy and nltk
ChatGPT said:
Using spaCy and NLTK for email classification allows you to go beyond simple keyword matching ‚Äî enabling smarter understanding of language using techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Here's a beginner-friendly guide for both:

üß† GOAL: Classify emails using spaCy/NLTK preprocessing and keyword rules.
‚úÖ 1. Install Libraries
pip install spacy nltk
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords wordnet
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
‚úÖ 2. Using spaCy for Preprocessing
Example: Lemmatize and clean email text
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def preprocess_spacy(text):
    doc = nlp(text.lower())
    return [token.lemma_ for token in doc if not token.is_stop and token.is_alpha]
‚úÖ 3. Using NLTK for Preprocessing
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

def preprocess_nltk(text):
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    return [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w) for w in words if w.isalpha() and w not in stop_words]
‚úÖ 4. Updated Keyword-Based Classification (with preprocessing)
email_categories = {
    "Work": ["meeting", "project", "deadline", "report", "client"],
    "Personal": ["birthday", "party", "family", "friend", "catch"],
    "Promotions": ["discount", "offer", "sale", "deal", "limited"],
    "Spam": ["lottery", "winner", "free", "money", "prize", "click"]
}

def classify_email(tokens, categories):
    for category, keywords in categories.items():
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword in tokens:
                return category
    return "Uncategorized"
‚úÖ 5. Full Example Using spaCy
emails = [
    "Don't miss our limited time offer on electronics!",
    "Hey, are you free this weekend to catch up?",
    "Client meeting rescheduled to next Monday.",
    "Congratulations! You are a lottery winner!",
    "Let's finalize the project report by Friday."
]

for email in emails:
    tokens = preprocess_spacy(email)  # or use preprocess_nltk(email)
    category = classify_email(tokens, email_categories)
    print(f"Email: '{email}' ‚Üí Tokens: {tokens} ‚Üí Category: {category}")
‚úÖ Output (with spaCy tokens)
Email: 'Don't miss our limited time offer on electronics!' ‚Üí Tokens: ['miss', 'limited', 'time', 'offer', 'electronic'] ‚Üí Category: Promotions
Email: 'Hey, are you free this weekend to catch up?' ‚Üí Tokens: ['hey', 'free', 'weekend', 'catch'] ‚Üí Category: Personal
...

Python -m spacy download error ssl certificate verify failed
ChatGPT said:
If you're seeing an error like:

ssl.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed
while running:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
It usually means that Python can't verify SSL certificates (often due to outdated certificates or missing root certs).

‚úÖ Fix Options (Choose One):
üõ†Ô∏è Option 1: Use pip instead
This often bypasses the SSL problem:

pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.7.1/en_core_web_sm-3.7.1-py3-none-any.whl
After installing, link it:

python -m spacy link en_core_web_sm en
üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Install Certificates Manually (macOS only)
If you're on macOS and using the system Python or python.org installer:

/Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command
This updates your certs.

üõ†Ô∏è Option 3: Set SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable (for Windows/Linux)
Download cacert.pem from https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem

Then in your terminal:

export SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cacert.pem      # Linux/Mac
set SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\path\to\cacert.pem       # Windows CMD
Then try:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
üõ†Ô∏è Option 4: Use requests to disable verification (not recommended)
This is insecure and should only be used if you're behind a proxy or testing:

import ssl
import urllib.request

ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.7.1/en_core_web_sm-3.7.1-py3-none-any.whl",
    "en_core_web_sm.whl"
)
Then install manually:

pip install en_core_web_sm.whl
Would you like me to detect your platform and give a step-by-step for your OS?

You said:
Spacy command depraxted
ChatGPT said:
As of spaCy v3.7 and later, the command python -m spacy download has been deprecated in favor of a new syntax.

Here‚Äôs how to properly install models now:

‚úÖ Recommended method:

Install using pip:

pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.7.1/en_core_web_sm-3.7.1-py3-none-any.whl

Then load it in your Python script like this:

import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

If you want to verify which models are installed, you can run:

python -m spacy validate

üìå Note: python -m spacy download still works in some older versions, but it will eventually be removed.

Would you like a helper script that checks and installs the model automatically if it's missing?
